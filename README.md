# BallisticsEX
 Demonstration of ballistics calculations using Unity.</br>
 Pressing spacebar causes one of the projectiles inside the box to launch upward, followed shortly by the other, which aims to collide with the first.</br>
 For some reason, the two fall through the floor of the box after doing so, however.</br>
